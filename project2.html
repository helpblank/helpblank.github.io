      <h2>FairBreeze Mobile App</h2>
      <p>This project was assigned as part of a digital entrepreneurship course at Texas A&M, and the aim of the project was to design a mobile app that provide resources for students to better take advantage of their time at career fairs.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>The app that we designed was primarily concerned with allowing students to spend less time waiting in line to talk to recruiters, as well as providing the student with introductory information about each company. Using several javaScript functions, as well as a MySQL server, we were able to get a working prototype that would allow for the creation and storage of user profiles, scheduling events that users could sign up for, and the ability for companies to create pages containing information in a digital "business card" for students to view.</p>
