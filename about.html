        <h3>I AM:</h3>
        <p>I'm a 24-year-old programmer with a degree in computer science from Texas A&M University, looking for entry-level opportunities in software design or support.</p>
        <h3>I'VE ACCOMPLISHED:</h3>
        <p>A number of group or solo projects spanning tons of different topics, across several different environments and languages throughout my time in college. Additionally, I have experience working in tech and media support roles where I was responsible for installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting user issues with equipment at large organizations (see my resume for specific details).  </p>
        <h3>I WANT TO:</h3>
        <p>Begin my professional career, so that I can make useful things with smart people. My main motivation is that I want to contribute to something bigger than myself while learning and expanding my skillset for conquering bigger and bigger challenges, because to quote Epictetus, "The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it."</p>
        <h3>MY PURPOSE:</h3>
        <p>Plain and simple, I love programming because it's the perfect intersection of creativity and logic. I love the exchange of knowledge and ideas that occurs between programmers, and the fact that there is no limit to a person's ability to continue to improve. It provides so many possibilities for unique solutions to any given problem, and no shortage of challenges to be overcome.</p>
        <h3>OUTSIDE OF PROGRAMMING, I ENJOY:</h3>
        <p>Like many computer scientists, I love playing video games, specifically OldSchool Runescape, Smash Bros Melee, and Noita at the moment. When I'm not on my computer, I'm usually either building some kind of DIY project in my backyard, rereading Tolkien, listening to progressive rock or the newest King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard album, or hiking with my girlfriend.</p>
